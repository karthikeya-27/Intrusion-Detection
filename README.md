# üõ°Ô∏è Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

This project is a real-time, explainable AI-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) built using a hybrid of deep learning and classical machine learning. It is designed to monitor and classify network traffic, detect anomalies, and interpret decisions in real-time.

##  Key Features

- **Anomaly Detection with Autoencoder**  
  Learns the normal behavior of network traffic and detects deviations without needing labeled attack data.

- **Attack Classification using Random Forest**  
  Known attack patterns are classified using a trained Random Forest model into categories like DoS, Brute Force, Port Scanning, etc.

- **Imbalanced Data Handling with SMOTE**  
  Applies SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance attack vs. normal traffic classes during training.

- **Explainable AI with LIME**  
  Each classification decision is accompanied by LIME-based local interpretations to explain which features influenced the model‚Äôs prediction.

- **Real-time Web Dashboard (Frontend)**  
  A live interface displays:
  - Detected attack type  
  - Risk score  
  - LIME explanations for model decisions  
  - Packet flow and feature visualization

## Machine Learning Overview

### 1. **Autoencoder (Unsupervised Learning)**
- Trained on benign traffic only
- Detects anomalous traffic by reconstruction error
- Used for zero-day attack detection

### 2. **Random Forest Classifier (Supervised Learning)**
- Trained on labeled attack data (after SMOTE balancing)
- Classifies anomalies into known categories
- Outputs: Attack Type and Risk Score

### 3. **Interpretability using LIME**
- Provides feature-level explanation for each classified attack
- Highlights most influential features for a given prediction
